  <p style="font-size:16px; color: #1C9FD8"> Functional Data Analysis for Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) Data </p>
  <p style="font-size:14px; color: #9F1CD8"> Nov 2019 - Dec 2019 (Functional Data Analysis Course Project) &nbsp; </p>
	<li> Use functional data methods to study the ZHVI data (data visualization, outlier detection, data inference, data clustering, 
		exploring the underlying correlation between two random functional objects). </li>
</ul>

	<li> Propose an elastic-net type estimator for functional linear regression with scalar responses and 
		functional predictors under a reproducing kernel Hilbert space framework. </li>
	<li> Establish precise conditions on the problem dimension 
		(number of observations, total number of features, number of true features) 
		and the scope and ratio of L1 and L2 penalty that are sufficient for variable selection consistency. </li>
</ul>

  <p style="font-size:16px; color: #1C9FD8"> A Hierarchical Spatial Finlay-Wilkinson Model for 
	  Analysis of Multi-Environment Field Trials </p>
  <p style="font-size:14px; color: #9F1CD8"> Jan 2018 - Present (Ph.D thesis project) &nbsp;
	<a href="https://github.com/xingcheg/MLCAS-2019"> [See project] </a> </p>
	<li> Build a Bayesian hierarchical model for understanding and predicting crop performance across environments 
		by integrating massive data from different sources 
		(i.e. genomic, environmental, and within-field spatial data). </li>
	<li> Propose methodology for simultaneously modeling spatial correlation in multi-environment trials 
		and design fast computation algorithms for simulating high-dimensional spatial effects 
		in MCMC procedures. </li>

	<li>  Extensively explore the model features and develop logistic ensemble model 
		(ensemble the complex models with simpler models to maintain the prediction accuracy 
		and stability at the same time). </li>
