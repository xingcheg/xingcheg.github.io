<ul>
  <p style="font-size:15px; color: #1C9FD8"> A Novel Machine Learning Algorithm for 
	  Extracting Growth Curves of Multiple Plants from a Sequence of Field Plant Photos </p>
	<li> Implement neural network for plant image segmentation (distinguish plant 
		from noisy field backgrounds ). </li>
	<li> Provide solutions for automatic plant height measurement providing a sequence of 
		plant field photos over time. </li>
	<li>  Develop robust models for plant growth curve fitting. </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <p style="font-size:15px; color: #1C9FD8"> An RKHS Approach for Variable Selection in 
	  High Dimensional Functional Linear Models </p>
	<li> Propose an elastic-net type estimator for functional linear regression with scalar responses and 
		functional predictors under a reproducing kernel Hilbert space framework. </li>
	<li> To establish precise conditions on the problem dimension, the number of nonzero elements, 
		and the number of observations that are necessary and sufficient for sparsity pattern recovery 
		using the functional elastic-net method. </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <p style="font-size:15px; color: #1C9FD8"> A Hierarchical Spatial Finlay-Wilkinson Model for 
	  Analysis of Multi-Environment Field Trials </p>
	<li> Build a Bayesian hierarchical model for understanding and predicting crop performance 
		across environments by integrating massive data from different sources 
		(i.e. genomic, environmental, and within-field spatial data). </li>
	<li> Propose projected intrinsic autoregression prior (PIAR) for spatial adjustment of 
		fertility that alleviates an identifiability issue. </li>
	<li>  Design matrix free fast computation algorithms for simulating high-dimensional 
		GxE and spatial effects in MCMC procedures. </li>
	<li> Publish Rcpp package spFW on Github. </li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <p style="font-size:15px; color: #1C9FD8"> Automated Fraud Detection Model for Self-Scanning Systems </p>
	<li> Derive an optimal threshold value to classify the two groups given an 
		unbalanced evaluation function. </li>
	<li> Train the data model using the state of the art machine learning methods 
		(logistic regression, naive Bayes, random forest, SVM, XGBoost, neural network). </li>
	<li>  Extensively explore the model features and develop logistic ensemble model 
		(ensemble the complex models with simpler models to maintain the prediction accuracy 
		and stability at the same time). </li>
