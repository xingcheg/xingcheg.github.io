  <p style="font-size:15px;"> A Novel Machine Learning Algorithm for Extracting Growth Curves of Multiple Plants 
	  from a Sequence of Field Plant Photos </p>
	<li> Implement neural network for plant image segmentation (distinguish plant from noisy field backgrounds ). </li>
	<li> Provide solutions for automatic plant height measurement providing a sequence of plant field photos over time. </li>
	<li>  Develop robust models for plant growth curve fitting. </li>
