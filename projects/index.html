<h1> Course and Research Projects </h1>


<ul>
  <p style="font-size:15px;"> A Novel Machine Learning Algorithm for Extracting Growth Curves of Multiple Plants 
	  from a Sequence of Field Plant Photos </p>
	<li> Implement neural network for plant image segmentation (distinguish plant from noisy field backgrounds ). </li>
	<li> Provide solutions for automatic plant height measurement providing a sequence of plant field photos over time. </li>
	<li>  Develop robust models for plant growth curve fitting. </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <p style="font-size:15px;"> A RKHS Approach for Variable Selection in High Dimensional Functional Linear Models </p>
	<li> Propose an elastic-net type estimator for functional linear regression with scalar responses and 
		functional predictors under a reproducing kernel Hilbert space framework. </li>
	<li> To establish precise conditions on the problem dimension, the number of nonzero elements, 
		and the number of observations that are necessary and sufficient for sparsity pattern recovery 
		using the functional elastic-net method. </li>
</ul>
